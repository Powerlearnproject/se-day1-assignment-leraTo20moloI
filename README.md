#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles and techniques to design,development,testing and maintainance of software systems.It plays a vital role in the technology industry by ensuring the development of high-quality,reliable and efficient software systems that meet the changing needs of customers and drive busines innovation

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Cloud Computing and DevOps: The widespead adopttion of cloud computing and DevOps practices has transformed the way software is developed, deployed and maintained. Cloud computing provides scalable infrastructure while DevOps emphasizes collaboration and automation.                                                                  Artificial Intelligence-Driven Software Development: The increasing use of artificial intelligence(AI) and machine learning(ML) in software development has given rise to AI-driven software development. This involves using AI to automate tasks, generate code and improve software quality.                                                Edge Computing:Edge computing involves processing data closer to where it is genarated reducing latency and improving real-time decision making. This trend is driven by the proliferation of loT devices and the need for faster, more efficient data processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Implementation: Write code, develop software components and integrate them into a functional system.

Maintenance: Monitor software performance, fix defects and implement updates ,patches and new features.                                                                 Verification: Confirm that the software works as expected, meets the required standards and is free from defects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology: It is Easy to manage and understand ,well-suited for projects with clear requirements and it also provides a clear timeline and milestones
Agile Methodology:It is flexible and adaptable to changing requirements , Allows for rapid prototyping and feedback and it encourages collaboration and communication among team members                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              WaterFall is suitable for projects with well defined requirements and low risk while Agile is suitable for projects with unclear or changing requirements and high risk.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process of writing instructions to get the best results from AI model.
Importance of Prompt Engineering Are: Improved Accuracy,Enhanced User Experience,Increased Efficiency,Mitigating Bias and Errors and Better Data Quality
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt is a text prompt or input that is unclear,ambiguous or open ended making it difficult for AI to understand the intended task,question or request. Improved prompt is more effective because it is a clear character and setting,specific genre and tone and concise and focused
